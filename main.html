								<h3>
									Balanced Egypt is a youth-led initiative dedicated to raising awareness about food waste and its social, environmental, and economic impacts. We believe that reducing food waste is key to building a more sustainable and child-friendly urban future.

								</h3>
								<p>
                                    Balanced Egypt was born during the preparations for COP27, where we noticed a significant gap: while global conversations on climate change were gaining momentum, the issue of food waste was barely being addressed in Egypt. As a group of passionate young individuals, we saw this as an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution. We realized that food waste wasn’t just an environmental concern but also a pressing social issue with wide-ranging economic and health implications.

                                    Driven by this realization, we decided to take action. We began researching the issue, only to find that food waste in Egypt was not getting the attention it deserved. That’s when Balanced Egypt was born. Our mission quickly became clear: to raise awareness, educate people on the importance of reducing food waste, and implement sustainable solutions.
                                    
                                    From that moment on, we committed ourselves to addressing this issue head-on. Our goal is to lead the charge in changing how Egyptians view food, consumption, and waste, while providing practical, eco-friendly solutions that can make a lasting impact.								</p>
